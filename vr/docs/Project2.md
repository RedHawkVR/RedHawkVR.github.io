# Mystic Arts 101 Outline

#### Goal
Focus on the ball to make it float.
Drop the ball into a basket to win.

Focus values will be read from a Neurosky Mindwave Mobile.
The focus values will be used to determine how high the ball floats.

Focus = Y value

If ball goes outside of camera view, stop measuring focus (drop the ball). 

There will be 3 levels, 1 done by each student.
